# Programming Game AI by Example Source Code
What you see here is the source code for the 2004 book "[Programming Game AI by Example](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Example-Wordware-Developers-Library/dp/1556220782/)" by Mat Buckland, passed down from reader to reader, since the original downloads mostly don't work.  

This source may frequently contain small edits made by me as I am trying to get C++ to play nice with VS Code.
